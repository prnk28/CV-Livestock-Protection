# Fire-Detector

Hack for Resilience

Detects the sizes of possible wildfires and the rate at which those fires are growing using Computer Vision/OpenCV. Gives a pre-emptive warning (phone alerts) to nearby individuals using Twilio. Has a MongoDB Stitch database of both surveillance-type videos (as in campgrounds, drones, etc.) and neightborhood cameras that can be continually added to, depending on which neighbors/individuals sign the agreement form using DocuSign.
